```

Output:

```
{
  "data": {
    "hello": "Hello World!"
  }
}
```

## Run tests

```sh
pnpm test
```

## Pre-commit hooks

This project uses [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to enforce code quality. You can install it by running:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

## Deployment

This template comes with two GitHub Actions that handle automatically deploying your app to production environment.

Prior to your first deployment, you'll need to do a few things:

- [Install Fly](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)

- Sign up and log in to Fly

  ```sh
  fly auth signup
  ```

- Create a new app on Fly:

  ```sh
  fly create fastify-starter
  ```

- Create a new [GitHub Repository](https://repo.new)

- Add a `FLY_API_TOKEN` to your GitHub repo. To do this, go to your user settings on Fly and create a new [token](https://web.fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens/new), then add it to [your repo secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) with the name `FLY_API_TOKEN`.

Now that every is set up you can commit and push your changes to your repo. Every commit to your `main` branch will trigger a deployment to your production environment.

## GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Anything that gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running tests/build/etc.
